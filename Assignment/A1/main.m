%% load the dataset
% Complementary Information:
% M&Ms dataset: a small dataset about the number of colored M&Ms in packets 
% and the packets weight (https://gist.github.com/giob1994/ffcd8c72a8a5477219aca9c5884c2094)
% variables

% determine the names of the variables in the dataset with the command
% "who"






%% 1.- Construct a linear regression model that predicts the weight of a given bag  
% provided the number of red candies in a bag. 
% Use 80% of the sample length for training and 20% for testing
% Compute the training (in-sample) and testing (out-of-sample) performance 
% of such model using l1, l2 (MSE) and Huber losses. 
% Show some usefull figures/charts/plots as stated in the assignment







%% 2.- Construct an example of multivariate regression with two colors
% regress on green and blue 
% Use 80% of the sample length for training and 20% for testing
% Compute the training (in-sample) and testing (out-of-sample) performance
% Show some usefull figures/charts/plots as stated in the assignment








%% 3.- Conclude which model is performing better for the testing sets:
